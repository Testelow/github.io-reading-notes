# # Code 102 Notes

My name is _Ty-Kiara_ I am 24 and I currently work as a business development contract manager on a business systems team. It is highly unusual but this happened because we have a contract management system. We are a very ***software implementation*** heavy team which is why I decided to take this course. During my time in the Marines my MOS was communications so my love for computers grew even more. I look forward to learning new skills that I can use in my current career and eventually start creating my own software.

<sub>Growth mindset</sub> is the internal understanding that learning and growing intellectually and personally starts with your **want** to learn and increase your overall knowledge and understanding.
>Get comfortable with being uncomforable
This is a saying that I learned in bootcamp, we were taught that everything we would experience would be uncomfortable but as soon as you accept that feeling it becomes normal and gets easier.
